Notes and TODOs.

- Thinking time should be proportional to the complexity of the brain.

- Energy consumption should determine how quickly an protozoa dies.
	- Larger brains increase energy consumption.
	- Larger bodies increase energy consumption.
	- Moving faster increases energy consumption.
	- More retina cells increases energy consumption.
	
- Health should be the primary fitness function.

- Eating shouldn't be a instantaneous process, a protozoa should absorb health from it's food
  at some determined rate.
  
- A fighting mechanism between protozoa should be implemented through 
- When two protozoa fight, how much of each other they absorb should be a result of the differential
  between each of their respective fighting abilities.
- A protozoa's fighting ability should be a result of it's size and health (plus a random element).



- Command line interface:
	- startsim ?pelletNumber ?protozoaNumber ?parentGenomes
		  starts new simulation
		  pelletNumber is the number of pellets in each generation (default = 100)
		  protozoaNumber is the number of protozoa in each generation (default = 60)
		  parentGenomes is a file containing a set of parent genomes for generation 0 (if left blank random genomes are used)
